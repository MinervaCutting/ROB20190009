## Los Cachitos

Since 2005 Los Cachitos restaurant offers diners a very wide set menu of Galician cuisine in Barcelona.

In this traditional restaurant we will find dishes made of the freshest raw material, meat and seafood from Galicia and fresh fish of the day of the Catalan coast in a very wide set menu that has sandwiches, appetizers and varied tapas, soups, rice, noodles, meats and fish.

Los Cachitos is located in a privileged area, very close to theaters and hotels, and has a large and cozy outdoor terrace and spacious lounges that are decorated in the style of Galician tavern, with walls painted in yellow, lots of wood and characteristic objects of this region.

## Palo Cortao

In the heart of Poble Sec, in Barcelona, we will find the restaurant Palo Cortao, a place where a cuisine of Cadiz roots is offered without fear of experiencing new textures.

In Palo Cortao the starters are like in an old tavern, with pork rinds in the style of C√°diz, Iberian ham and beef jerky. We can taste the mix of Andalusian and Catalan cuisine, sea and mountain where fish, rice and beef coexist in harmony.

In the small space, where the old brick floor stands out, 35 people fit between the bar and the wooden tables that fill the living room, at the back of the restaurant. The low ceiling, the furniture and its size make the evening intimate and cozy.
